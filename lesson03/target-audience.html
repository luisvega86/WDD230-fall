            <h2>Target Audeince and Scenarios</h2>
            <p> Mar del Plata is a tourist destination par excellence 
                located on the Atlantic coast of Argentina. The target 
                audience of the Mardel Chamber of Commerce are those 
                people who come to visit our city and even though those
                who actually live in Mar del Plata. We create a place 
                where they can access from any place or device and find 
                updated information about the activities that take place 
                in the city, and the local businesses promote their products
                and services.</p>
